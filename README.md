# A Demo of Machine Learning

Using [Toy-Neural-Network-JS](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Toy-Neural-Network-JS)

Check out [a live demo](http://andreiziureaev.com/ml-demo).

This demo uses pure JavaScript, the 2D Canvas API and a very simple neural network library to make a computer learn how to play Snake. It uses a genetic algorithm to evolve the snakes. The higher a snake's score, the higher its chance to pass its genes to the next generation.

Leave the simulation running at maximum ticks per second for 10 - 30 minutes to get somewhat decent snakes. Or just load the provided JSON into a snake and see if it can evolve any further.
